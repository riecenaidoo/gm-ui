/* <1> Scrolling Layout

We want the Playlists section to be the only portion of the site that scrolls, but the app itself should not.
To accomplish this we want the component to consume 100% of its parent's height, and then let the Playlists section grow
as large as possible (while preserving the size needed for the Control bar).

We need to use border-box sizing so the padding and border sizes for the elements are included in the calculation for its
height. If we do not do this the app itself will scroll because it will be of 100vh + margin/padding in height.
